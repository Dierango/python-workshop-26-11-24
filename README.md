# Banking System Workshop

This project serves as a practical workshop exercise for students who attended Python 101 and 102 courses offered by Google Developer Groups (GDG) on Campus at Bahçeşehir University. The workshop is scheduled for November 27, 2024.

## Project Description

This is a simple banking system implementation that allows students to practice core Python concepts including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- File Organization
- Data Structures (Dictionaries, Lists)
- Input/Output Operations
- Basic Error Handling
- DateTime Management

## Features

- Create and manage a bank
- Add customers with unique IDs
- Create multiple accounts per customer
- Perform transactions (deposits/withdrawals)
- View account balances
- Track transaction history
- List all customers and their accounts

## Project Structure

- [`main.py`](main.py): Contains the main program loop and user interface
- [`bank.py`](bank.py): Implements the Bank class
- [`customer.py`](customer.py): Implements the Customer class
- [`account.py`](account.py): Implements the Account class

## Learning Objectives

This workshop material helps students:
- Apply OOP concepts in a real-world scenario
- Practice working with multiple Python files
- Implement basic banking operations
- Handle user input and data validation
- Work with Python's datetime module

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `main.py` using Python 3.x
3. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the banking system

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge from Python 101 and 102 courses
- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Workshop Context

This is one of the first hands-on materials used in the Python workshop series by GDG on Campus BAU, designed to reinforce concepts learned in previous Python courses through practical application.
